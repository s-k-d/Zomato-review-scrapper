# Zomato-review-scrapper
Zomato Review Scraper
This project contains a Jupyter Notebook designed to scrape reviews from dynamic websites such as Zomato. The scraper uses web scraping techniques to fetch and process data efficiently. Follow the instructions below to set up and use the scraper.

## Features
1. Scrape user reviews from a dynamic website.
2. Handles dynamically loaded content using Selenium.
3. Export scraped data into a structured format for analysis.


## Dynamic Website Access:
Ensure you have access to the website you want to scrape (e.g., Zomato).  
Steps to Locate Containers


## Inspect the Web Page:
1. Open the target web page in a browser.
2. Right-click on the element you want to scrape (e.g., a rating or review) and select Inspect (or press Ctrl+Shift+I / Cmd+Option+I).
  This opens the browser's Developer Tools, where you can view the HTML structure.
3. Identify Unique Patterns:  
Look for unique identifiers (e.g., id, class, or HTML tags) for the elements containing the data. 
Pay attention to parent-child relationships and sibling elements that might help locate the target container.  

## Modify Parameters:

Update the following variables in the notebook:  
Website URL: The URL of the page you want to scrape.  
Output File Path: Specify where the scraped data should be saved.  
Export Scraped Data:After execution, the scraped data will be saved as a CSV file. Use it for further analysis or visualization.

### Important Notes
Dynamic Content Handling:  
This scraper is designed for websites that use JavaScript to load content dynamically.  
Selenium is used to render JavaScript-driven web pages.  

### Legal and Ethical Considerations:

Always check the website's Terms of Service before scraping.
Use this tool responsibly and avoid overloading the website's server.

### Error Handling:

If the script encounters issues, check:
Web driver version compatibility.
Internet connection stability.
The website structure (it may change over time).
